# My history with VR
Though I'd used friends' Oculuses and seen them at tech demos etc, the first VR equipment I owned was a Gear VR, which I used with the Galaxy S6 I was assigned by [work](https://www.facebook.com). This was a passable attempt at VR, but I didn't feel drawn to use it, and other than showing it to friends for a few minutes, it hasn't been touched in a year or more.

A [colleague](https://twitter.com/de_velopment) showed me her 2016 Daydream headset and I was immediately aware how much better it was than the Gear. This is partly because I'm now using a Note 8, which has a hugely higher resolution (and screen size) than the S6.

After playing for a while, we released there seems to be a bug affecting Samsung devices including my Note, but not her Pixel: NFC must be enabled on the phone, or the Daydream app won't start. But, due to some problem with the NFC in the headset lid, it helps to put metal foil between the lid and the device. Looks bonkers but solves a lot of problems.

# The 2017 model
I was impressed enough with the 2016 model to want my own. Looking at the 2017 model, it seems to fix a lot of the niggles I had wth the original: a top head strap helps stablise the unit so you don't need to adjust it so often, the sides are 'deeper' on the head, so you get much less light bleed, and the viewing angle of the lenses is far wider, so you're less distracted  by the black edges.

The problem of a need for foil still exists, and it even seems Google have tacitly acknowledged this in the new design by having the holding strap for the controller away from the lid. In any other case this would be a design regression, but it's more convenient if you need to leave a piece of foil on the lid.

I paid £79.99, with a promise of £35 worth of some of their recommended games, thought I haven't actually found a way to redeem this yet.

Overall I'm extremely impressed with Daydream as a device and as an ecosystem, and it's made me optimistic and excited about the Oculus Go, due early next year. I've ruled out buying a Rift for now because I'm just not willing to invest in the PC required.

# App reviews
*405 Road Rage*  
**Developer:** Lucid Sight | **Type:** Endless runner game | **Control:** Controller, steer + click | **Price:** free  
This is certainly the best free game I've played on the device, it's my go-to app to introduce the headset to people. Takes the form of a 3D endless driving game, in which you dodge and weave past traffic in various game modes. It makes great use of the controller to "steer" the car.

*Coastality*  
**Developer:**  | **Type:** 360 Videos collection | **Control:** none | **Price:** free  


*Amusement Planet*  
**Developer:** | **Type:** experience | **Control:** none | **Price:** first hit is free, £1 for more environments

*Arts and Culture by Google*  
**Developer:** Google | **Type:** experience | **Control:** look and point | **Price:** free  

*VR Flight Dash*  
**Developer:** shmyt  | **Type:** Endless runner game | **Control:** Head tilting | **Price:** free  
Fly a ship over a procedural sci-fi city. Genuinely fun avoiding buildings and zipping through tunnels. Let down by head-tilt controls.

*Avem 33 VR*  
**Developer:** WaRV | **Type:** Endless runner game | **Control:** Head tilting | **Price:** free  
Fly a ship through a series of rings, past a 3D sci-fi city. This is quite boring, not as good as similar games listed. I really don't enjoy head-tilt controls. You're given a choice of ships at the start but this doesn't seem to affect the game. Your run ends when you hit a building, but the Game Over screen is only printed on one eye, which is disrupting at first.
