# Using Daydream with Pixel 2
Pixel 2 is a very different experience to the Note 8. I didn't realise what I was missing in terms of Google being more capable with the software compared to Samsung. Regarding Daydream specifically, not having NFC bugs, so being able to just put the phone in the headset and have it run, is a much better experience. I'm more likely to just pick the thing up and use it, confident that it will just work, with no strange crashes or failure to load.

I didn't finish the reviews I intended to last time, but there are a few new and old app I wanted to make a note of.

## Voxel Fly
## Asteroids
Asteroids is a fun animation, but as beautiful and detailed as it is, it's really a one-time thing.
