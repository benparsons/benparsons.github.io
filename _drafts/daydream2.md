# Using Daydream with Pixel 2
Pixel 2 is a very different experience to the Note 8. I didn't realise what I was missing in terms of Google being more capable with the software compared to Samsung. Regarding Daydream specifically, not having NFC bugs, so being able to just put the phone in the headset and have it run, is a much better experience. I'm more likely to just pick the thing up and use it, confident that it will just work, with no strange crashes or failure to load.

I didn't finish the reviews I intended to last time, but there are a few new and old app I wanted to make a note of.

# Apps and Games
## Voxel Fly
My new favourite flying game. The controls are very different to Ultrawings, and take a little getting used to, but the are very smooth once I did. The graphics are cellshaded, and for some reason remind me strongly of [this old Kongretate Flash tutorial](https://www.kongregate.com/labs). I especially enjoyed the mission ordering, which veers wildly between a leisurely exploration and maddeningly fast shooting. The soundtrack is appropriate and fun too.
## Asteroids
Asteroids is a fun animation, but as beautiful and detailed as it is, it's really a one-time thing. It works as an effective app for people new to VR, maybe.
## Art Plunge
## Google Stories
## Swish
There is probably a good game somewhere inside Swish. It's a hovercraft-ish racing game, and for the most part can be fun. There are so many issue which spoil the experience though. Firstly, I'm not sure, even after probably an hour of gameplay, that I really understand the accelerator control. Sometimes it will just drop to zero without me doing anything, or won't go beyond about 90% speed, which leads me to holding the controller really gingerly to try to avoid breaking it further. Next, the AI are bizarre to play with, and this is most noticable on the time-trial style events, where they will either crash without needing to, or suddenly become very agressive, suiciding themselves into you and each other. I wanted to enjoy Swish, and stuck it out because there are some really nice touches, like the sound effects when you overtake, but the problems with this game are too many right now.
